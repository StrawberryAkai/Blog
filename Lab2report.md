## Introducation
        Bug, a word that represent inssants, but in computer programming, this word represent errors. Bugs are everywhere just like insants are everywhere. There is no way to avoid bugs, not even the best programmer in the world will avoid it. 
        
        Some bugs are easy to find, but some don't. Best way to fix those unseen bugs is work with your friends or ask others that have more experience than you.

<span style = font-size:20px> This program is basically storing the link address that markdown renders in the arraylist and return the valid address(s) that store in the arraylist, but notice how the test is perfect and the format is also the markdown renders format. Can this conclude that the program is perfect? Obviously no, there are other tests that will break the program easily.</span>
